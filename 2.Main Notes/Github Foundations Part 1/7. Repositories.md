# What is a Repository?
A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. It's one of the essential parts that helps you collaborate with people. You can use repositories to manage your work, track changes, store revision history, and work with others. Before we dive too deep, let’s first start with how to create a repository.

# How to create a repo?
You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions.

Let’s walk through how to create a repository from github.com.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the drop-down menu, and select **New repository**.
2. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu to select the account you want to own the repository.
3. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.
4. Choose a repository visibility.
    - **Public repositories** are accessible to everyone on the internet.
    
    - **Private repositories** are only accessible to you, people you explicitly share access with, and, for organization repositories, certain organization members.
    
5. Select **Create repository** and congratulations! You just created a repository!

# How to Clone a repo
Cloning a repository allows you to create a local copy of a repository on your computer. This is useful for making changes locally and syncing them back to the remote repository.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository you want to clone.
    
2. Above the list of files, click the **Code** button.
	
3. 1. Copy the URL for the repository using the HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI option.
    
4. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    
5. Run the following command, replacing `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied: `git clone <repository-url>`
	
6. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the repository folder: 
	`cd <repository-name>` 

# How to add files to repo?
Files in GitHub can do a handful of things, but the main purpose of files is to store data and information about your project. To add a file to a repository, you need at least **Write** access.

Let’s review how to add a file to your repository.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
    
2. In your repository, browse to the folder where you want to create a file by selecting the **creating a new file** link or **uploading an existing file**.
    
3. Once added, above the list of files select the **Add file ᐁ** drop-down menu. Then select **Create new file**.
	
4. In the file name field, type the name and extension for the file. To create subdirectories, type the **/** directory separator.
    
5. In the file contents text box, type **content** for the file.
    
6. To review the new content, above the file contents, select **Preview**.
	
7. Select **Commit changes**.
    
8. In the **Commit message** field, type a short and meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message.
    
9. If you have more than one email address associated with your account on GitHub.com, select the email address drop-down menu. Then select the email address to use as the Git author email address. Only verified email addresses appear in this drop-down menu. If you enabled email address privacy, then _[username]@users.noreply.github.com_ is the default commit author email address.
	
10. Below the **Commit message** fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit, and then create a pull request.
	
11. Select **Commit changes** or **Propose changes**.
