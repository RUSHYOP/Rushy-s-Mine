Linus Torvalds is the dude who created **Linux**, the operating system kernel that powers literally half the tech world — servers, Android phones, supercomputers, you name it. Finnish-American software engineer, major introvert, zero interest in corporate BS.

# His Story

- 1991: Linus was a uni student messing around with computers

- He got annoyed with MS-DOS and wanted something better

- So he casually posted **“Hey, I’m making a free OS”** on Usenet

- Open-source community jumped in → Linux blew up

- Today Linux is everywhere, silently running the internet while Windows takes the spotlight.

# Innovations

- **Linux Kernel**
    
    - Not just an OS — it’s the foundation for countless systems
        
    - Designed for performance, flexibility, and freedom
        
- **Git**
    
    - Created in 2005 because existing version control systems sucked
        
    - Now it's the **#1 tool** for developers worldwide
        
    - Without Git → no GitHub → chaos
        
- **Open-source Culture**
    
    - His “just build it better together” mindset changed software forever

### **Major Achievements**

- **IEEE Computer Pioneer Award**
    
- **Millennium Technology Prize** (basically the Nobel Prize for tech)
    
- Featured in tons of “Most Influential Innovators” lists
    
- Linux now:
    
    - Runs **100%** of the world’s top 500 supercomputers
        
    - Dominates servers, cloud, cybersecurity, IoT
        
    - **Android = Linux kernel** → billions of devices daily

### **Why He’s a Legend**

Because he built the backbone of the modern internet **for free**, shared it with everyone, and still maintains it today. His work made tech more accessible, more reliable, and way more innovative.
