# Github Issues

GitHub Issues are used to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub. Issues can be created in various ways, so you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow.

This walkthrough covers how to create an issue from a repository. Issues can also be created from:

- An item in a task list.
- A note in a project.
- A comment in an issue or pull request.
- A specific line of code.
- A URL query.

# Github Discussions

Discussions are designed for conversations that aren’t necessarily tied to code—such as Q&A, ideas, or general feedback. They support open, ongoing communication within a shared forum and can be public or private, depending on the repository's visibility.
