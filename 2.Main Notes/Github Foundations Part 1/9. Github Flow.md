# Components of Github Flow
Git provides tools to track and manage changes in your code over time. GitHub builds on this by making it easier to use those tools with features like branches, commits, pull requests, and visual interfaces for collaboration. Let’s start by looking at how these concepts work in GitHub.

# What are branches?
Branches are an essential part of the GitHub experience. They let you make changes without affecting the default branch.

Your branch is a safe place to experiment with new features or fixes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push more changes to fix the mistake. Your changes won't update on the default branch until you merge your branch.

# What are commits?
In the previous unit, you added a new file into the repository by pushing a commit. Let’s briefly review what commits are.

A **commit** is a change to one or more files on a branch. Each commit is tracked by a unique ID, timestamp, and contributor, regardless of whether it's made via the command line or directly in GitHub's web interface. Commits provide a clear audit trail for anyone reviewing the history of a file or linked item, such as an issue or pull request.
		`git commit -m "Add a helpful commit message"`

Within a git repository, a file can exist in several valid states as it goes through the version control process. The primary states for a file in a Git repository are **Untracked** and **Tracked**.

**Untracked:** An initial state of a file when it isn't yet part of the Git repository. Git is unaware of its existence.

**Tracked:** A tracked file is one that Git is actively monitoring. It can be in one of the following substates:

- **Unmodified:** The file is tracked, but it hasn't been modified since the last commit.
- **Modified:** The file has been changed since the last commit, but these changes aren't yet staged for the next commit.
- **Staged:** The file has been modified, and the changes have been added to the staging area (also known as the index). These changes are ready to be committed.
- **Committed:** The file is in the repository's database. It represents the latest committed version of the file.

These states help your team understand the status of each file and where it is in the version control process.
