# What are pull requests?
A **pull request** is the mechanism used to signal that the commits from one branch are ready to be merged into another branch.

The team member submitting the **pull request** asks one or more reviewers to verify the code and approve the merge. These reviewers have the opportunity to comment on changes, add their own, or use the pull request itself for further discussion.

GitHub also supports _Draft Pull Requests_, which let you open a pull request that's not yet ready for review.

Once the changes have been approved (if required), the pull request's source branch (the compare branch) is merged into the base branch.

# Github Flow types

Git flow uses several long-lived and temporary branches:

- **master**: Always reflects production-ready code.
- **develop**: Contains the latest development work for the next release.
- **feature/***: Used to create new features; branched from `develop` and merged back when complete.
- **release/***: Prepares a new production release from `develop`; allows final testing and minor bug fixes.
- **hotfix/***: Used to quickly patch production issues; branched from `master`.

# How it works?

1. Developers create **feature branches** from `develop` to build new functionality.
2. When it's time for a release, a **release branch** is created from `develop`. This isolates release preparation work so development can continue uninterrupted.
3. Bug fixes can be added to the release branch, but major features should wait for a future release.
4. Once ready, the release branch is merged into `master` and tagged with a version number. GitHub can use these tags to help you generate release notes.
5. The same release branch should be merged back into `develop` to keep it in sync.
6. If a critical production bug arises, a **hotfix branch** is created from `master`. Once fixed, it’s merged into both `master` and `develop`.
